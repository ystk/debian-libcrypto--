This is the Debian GNU/Linux version of the Crypto++ library.

The original source is cryptopp560.zip with sha1sum
b836783ebd72d5bc6a916620ab2b1ecec316fef1 obtained from
http://www.cryptopp.com/ . 

It was unpacked with unzip -a to avoid DOS text format which breaks
the test suite, and the following files removed: *.dsp *.vcproj *.dsw
*.sln *.rc cryptlib_bds.* cryptest_bds.* resource.h .
